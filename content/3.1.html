<h1><span>3.1</span> Understand the use case</h1>

<div class="content-left">

	<p>In determining the use case for your data you should capture three issues:</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Why you wish to share or release your data</li>
	  <li>Who will want to access your data</li>
	  <li>How those accessing your data may want to use it</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Your use case provides context on how and what data you should release. If your core users want access to a particular variable you consider risky, you may need to restrict  who has access to that data, via accredited researchers, for example. To meet your obligations to produce <em>safe, useful data</em> you may also share it with a wider audience under a different licence by restricting a lot of the detail.

These variables are usually anonymised or even omitted. But in this case they are the core variables, so the anonymisation methods focus on other information like demographics.</p>
