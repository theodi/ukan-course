<h1><span>1.1</span> Describing the data situation</h1>

<div class="content-left">
	<p>To anonymise data it's important to take into account its 'environment'. </p>
<p><strong>What do we mean by an environment?</strong></p>
<p>It is, in a broad sense, the context for data. An environment includes:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>other data</li>
	<li>people who interact with the data</li>
	<li>their responsibilities and governance, and</li>
	<li>the infrastructure for processing and protecting it</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>What do we mean by a data situation?</strong></p>
<p>The relationship between data and its environment is referred to as a ‘data situation’. How a data custodian has come by the data, the data itself, what role and responsibilities the data custodian(s) has and to whom, whether it shares and/or releases products of that data and how it does this, all come together to create particular data situations.</p>
