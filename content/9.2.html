<h1><span>9.2</span> Plan what happens next once you have shared or released data
</h1>

<div class="content-left">
	<p>Revisit on a regular basis data that you have shared or released. It is good practice to periodically reconsider both its risk and usefulness.</p>

	<p>At the very least, you should:</p>

	<ul>
	<li>keep a register of all the data your share or release </li>
	<li>consider any new shares and releases against previous shares and releases</li>
	<li>scan the data environment by looking at <ul>
		<li>other similar data released by organisations in your sector</li>
		<li>publicly available data sources</li>
		<li>how and who uses your data</li>
	</ul></li>
	</ul>
