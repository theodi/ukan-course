	<h1><span>0.2</span> How to use the Anonymisation Decision-Making Framework (ADF)
</h1>

	<div class="content-left">
	<p class="ignore">The ADF can be used at three levels, as:</p>

<div class="cool-ol">
	<ol>
		<li><p>A tool to boost your data knowledge
</p></li>
		<li><p>A guide to help you understand your data situation</p></li>
		<li><p>A practical guide to help you decide how to anonymise your data</p></li>
	</ol>
</div>

<p><strong>You can use the ADF in different ways depending on your knowledge and skills.</strong> </p>
<p>At level 3 you will need to make complex judgement calls about when data is sufficiently anonymised given your data situation. The ADF will help you to make sound decisions based on best practice. However, it can only do this within the context of the knowledge and skills you bring. Where necessary, you should seek advice from appropriate experts.</p>

<p>The relationship between data and its environment is referred to as a ‘data situation’. In a <em>dynamic</em> data situation, data are moved from at least one environment to another. How a data custodian has come by the data, the data itself, what role and responsibilities the data custodian(s) has and to whom, whether it shares and/or releases products of that data and how it does this, all come together to create particular data situations.</p>
