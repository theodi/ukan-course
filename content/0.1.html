	<h1><span>0.1</span> The Anonymisation Decision-Making Framework</h1>

	<div class="content-left">
	<p>Anonymisation is about managing risk.</p>
<p>The process of anonymising data involves a balance  between producing safe data and useful data. There is no such thing as zero risk but that is true in other areas of life as well, and it does not mean that precautions are not immensely useful.  We don’t say: fire safety measures are pointless because there are fires. When anonymisation is done well the risk of a data breach should be negligible. </p>   

<p>This course has been developed by the [UK Anonymisation Network (UKAN)](http://ukanon.net). Anonymisation is the process by which personal data are rendered non-personal.</p> 
<p>A central feature of UKAN’s approach - called the anonymisation decision-making framework - is the tenet that  we cannot carry out effective anonymisation by just looking at the data; the context is crucial.</p>
