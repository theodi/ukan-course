	<p><strong>Step 3. Testing the scenarios developed in step 2 – penetration testing</strong></p>

	<p><em>The key is to document each step you take to assess and protect against risk.
</em></p>

	<p>
		Penetration testing can be useful to validate assumptions by simulating attacks using “friendly” intruders. The ICO recommend carrying out a motivated intruder test as part of a practical assessment of a dataset’s risk.</p>
		
	<ul>
		<li>Are there other sources of data that can be linked that haven’t been considered?</li>
		 <li>How easy is it to manipulate the data and find people in practice?</li>
		 <li>Can you gauge an approximate level of risk in the data?</li>
	</ul>

	Penetration testing can be useful to validate assumptions by simulating attacks using “friendly” intruders. The ICO recommend carrying out a <em>motivated intruder</em> test as part of a practical assessment of a dataset’s risk. For example, the statisticians at Department of Energy & Climate Change went through several tests for the national energy efficiency data. A prize for correctly re-identifying an individual was not claimed by a group of motivated postgraduate students in computer science.

<p>There are also statistical techniques for assessing risk although these are complex and can be difficult for a non-expert to interpret.
