<h1><span>1.3</span> Describing the data situation</h1>

<div class="content-left">

<p><strong>Below is an example of a data situation</strong></p>

<p>Busmapper Ltd. collects data from its customers on public transport use. It wishes to share an anonymised version of the data with the Local Authority (LA) to support the LA provision of public transport. This is environment 1.</p>

<p>The LA has signed a data sharing agreement with Busmapper Ltd. to analyse the data. This is environment 2.</p>

<p>Critical issues when describing your data situation include: </p>

<ul>
	<li>your data</li>
	<li>legal and governance issues and</li>
	<li>the issues around consent and ethics</li>
</ul>

<p>We will cover them in components 2, 3, 4 and 5 of the ADF.
